<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Suna, an almost 37-year-old beginner in coding with a journey full of twists and turns.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in China, where I lived until I turned 20. In 2008, I moved to Denmark to further my education
in Multimedia Design and E-Concept Communication. Ironically, despite earning my degree, 
I walked away with very little knowledge in the field—God knows how I managed! During my studies, 
I fell in love with the food and beverage industry, a passion that led me to work in that field alongside 
my education from 2008 to 2014. After completing my studies, I returned to China and continued in the food and beverage 
industry until 2017. But my story doesn’t end there! </p> 

<p>At the end of 2017, I moved to France with zero knowledge of French and started my life from scratch. After plenty of hard 
work (and learning the language—you know how it goes), I built a new life. In 2023, a health issue forced me to step away from 
the food and beverage industry. During my recovery, I started exploring new career paths and stumbled upon coding. I don’t 
remember exactly why I tried it, but once I did, I fell in love with it. That’s when I decided to "pick up" the threads of my 
initial education in multimedia design from Denmark—this time with a clear goal and renewed passion. Now, I’m committed to 
building a future in web development.</p>

<p>I’ve set a goal to acquire solid coding skills before beginning a Web Developer training program on February 17th, 2025. 
By then, I aim to design fully functional websites and create a portfolio that will open the door to exciting new opportunities.</p>

<h2>31/12/2024 Happy New Year, everyone! </h2>
